How to undo a "git add ."
for preserving the local changes and discarding the commit use
git reset <file>
or 
git reset

if you do not want to preserve the changes and want to go back to the last commited then use
git reset --hard <last good SHA>

The First option is the safest option, but often, you’ll want to “undo” the commits and the changes in one move—that’s what --hard does.



command for undo git commit 

git reset HEAD~


command for undo git push 
as if the commit never really existed (dangerous if others are working with you and might have pulled changes from your wrongly pushed ones)

git reset --hard HEAD~
git push -f


if adding another commit but reverting the changes instead in the last commit (useful while working in colaboration)
git revert
git push -f
